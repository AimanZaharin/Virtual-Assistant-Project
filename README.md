The goal of our project, Speech Recognition with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to 
recognize the user’s speech and be able to comprehend and execute commands based on said given 
speech. The Speech Recognition serves as a means of communication, whilst the Natural Language 
Processing helps computers interpret and carry out commands. We train the AI with the dataset that we 
made ourselves using the Multinomial Naïve Bayes Algorithm which is basically a popular NLP 
Algorithm. Our primary strategy is to classify the user’s speech with an intent that will be recognized 
by the AI via text. The flow of our AI is speech-to-text, and text-to-speech. As a result, the general 
parameters are that we will be speaking with intent and will be changed as text, and the text will then 
be classified through the algorithm to predict the intent and functions needed to execute the commands 
that are associated with said intent. The program will then return an output text that will go through a 
text-to-speech algorithm that will reply to the user through voice. Our environment revolves around 
greetings, weather, date and time, and location. This report will include the AI solution/technique that
is implemented in our code, as well as the points that can be concluded after creating this assignment.
